## Installation
We encourage merchants to install our core modules via our combined **Dotdigital - Marketing Automation** extension:
- View the listing on [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/dotdigital-dotdigital-magento2-os-package.html).

**Steps:**
1. You must ‘purchase’ the [core extension](https://marketplace.magento.com/dotdigital-dotdigital-magento2-os-package.html) from the Marketplace.
2. Any existing `require` instructions in your composer.json relating to `dotmailer/*` packages must be removed.
3. Now, require the package.
```
composer require dotdigital/dotdigital-magento2-os-package
```

## Usage and support
Full support documentation and setup guides are available [here](https://support.dotdigital.com/en/collections/5610169-magento-open-source-and-adobe-commerce).

### CLI commands
#### sync
Run the sync commands on demand. Useful when troubleshooting cron issues.
```
bin/magento dotdigital:sync
```
This will yield a list of options:
```
Please select a Dotdigital sync to run
  [0 ] AbandonedCart
  [1 ] Automation
  [2 ] Campaign
  [3 ] Catalog
  [4 ] Customer
  [5 ] Guest
  [6 ] Importer
  [7 ] IntegrationInsights
  [8 ] Order
  [9 ] Review
  [10] Subscriber
  [11] Template
  [12] Wishlist
  [13] NegotiableQuote (B2B module required)
```

#### task
A task-runner for utility jobs that aren't syncs. Again, these have crons, so you wouldn't normally need to run these manually.
```
bin/magento dotdigital:task
```
This will yield a list of options:
```
Please select a dotdigital CLI task to run
  [0] Cleaner
  [1] SmsSenderManager (SMS module required)
```

#### migrate
The `migrate` command is a way to re-run the module's data installation process after initial install. 
```
bin/magento dotdigital:migrate [--table=<table_name>]
```
You may supply the following table options: 
```
email_contact
email_order
email_review
email_wishlist
email_catalog
email_b2b_quote (B2B module required)
```
Running `migrate` with no options supplied will re-run the complete data installation process. 

**Warning:** 
- `migrate` starts by truncating tables (either the table you supplied as an option, or, if no options were provided, all `email_` tables).
- You may lose previously saved data with this operation.
- `migrate` will not overwrite a previously-saved dynamic content passcode (4.13.6+).
